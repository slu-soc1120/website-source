## Confederate Monuments
The data we discussed about monuments to the Confederacy comes from a [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/) report on [Confederate Monuments](https://www.splcenter.org/20190201/whose-heritage-public-symbols-confederacy). An updated version of the image on the slides is also available [in the report](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/com_whose_heritage_timeline_print.pdf). Among these are the schools I mentioned that are memorials to Confederate officers:

> Of the 103 public schools and three colleges named for Confederates leaders, those honoring Robert E. Lee are the most numerous (42), followed by Stonewall Jackson (15), Jefferson Davis (11), Nathan Bedford Forrest (8), P.G.T. Beauregard (7) and John Reagan (6).

I also mentioned the ties between [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day) and [Robert E. Lee Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee_Day). The same [Southern Poverty Law Center report](https://www.splcenter.org/20190201/whose-heritage-public-symbols-confederacy) discusses these holidays that mark aspects of the Confederacy:

> The nine holidays officially observed in 2018 are: Alabama (Robert E. Lee Day, Confederate Memorial Day and Jefferson Davis’ Birthday); Mississippi (Robert E. Lee Day, Confederate Memorial Day and Jefferson Davis’ Birthday); South Carolina (Confederate Memorial Day); Texas (Confederate Heroes’ Day); Virginia (Lee-Jackson Day).

> The other states that have Confederate holidays in their state codes are Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina and Tennessee.

Marking these holidays and the Civil War more generally as a war about "states' rights" or "northern aggression" is a cultural holdover from the ["Lost Cause" myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy). In DeKalb County, Georgia, officials have now installed a plaque next to an existing Confederate monument that [provides context about the "lost cause"](https://www.ajc.com/news/local/marker-supplies-historical-context-for-dekalb-confederate-monument/3mGyZ6ITzCEGVgz785O1zJ/?fbclid=IwAR0iRmJHE3WtLX7J17OJ6bcAplgrcn9eROfsmUCavlBsxp7fex-moAizXMw#).


## Latino Health Paradox
While Latino immigrants [have better health on average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_paradox), one thing the documentary for today does not get into is that Latino is an overly broad term. [Recent research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5757955/) has found, for example, that not all Latinos in the United States have the same positive health advantages.


## Stanford Prison Experiment
The experiment run by [Philip Zimbaro, Ph.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Zimbardo) quickly became notorious for the ethical lapses that occurred during its short run. However, [recent reporting](https://gen.medium.com/the-lifespan-of-a-lie-d869212b1f62) has revealed that participants were coached and some of the seminal moments of the experiment were acted out. Though Zimbaro [has denied the allegations](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/6/28/17509470/stanford-prison-experiment-zimbardo-interview), the study is now an example not just of the ethics of conducting research but also reporting that research honestly as well.


## Other People
We also briefly mentioned the following people:
* [Gen. Jubal Early, CSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubal_Early) (1816-1894) - solidified the idea of the ["Lost Cause"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy) myth in writings and public appearances 
* [Stanley Milgrim, Ph.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Milgram) (1933-1984) - famous for his experiment on authority and obedience (the "Milgrim experiment")


## Other Topics
We also briefly mentioned the following concepts and historical events:

* [The Belmont Report](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html) - a guiding document for how we have responded to lapses in research ethics
* [The Tuskegee Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment)
* [Marion County, AL's TB Outbreak](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ecpe/tuberculosis-in-rural-america-what-tuberculosis-in-marion-al-tells-us/)
