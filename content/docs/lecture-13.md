## 1033 Program
We discussed the Clinton administration's expansion of a [pre-existing program](https://www.newsweek.com/how-americas-police-became-army-1033-program-264537) to transfer military equipment to police departments, known as the ["1033 Program"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1033_program). The program has transferred billions in equipment to police departments, and has continued despite [growing concern](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-missouri-shooting-militarization/obama-orders-review-of-police-use-of-military-hardware-idUSKBN0GN0O920140824) in the wake of the [Ferguson protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson_unrest) and additional protests in Baltimore.


## Willie Horton
We discussed the infamous [Willie Horton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Horton) campaign ad from the [1988 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_United_States_presidential_election). Here is the ad itself:

## People
We briefly mentioned the following people:

* [Kitty Genovese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese) (d. 1964) - a 29 year old woman who was brutally murdered in Queens, New York City, in 1964. Notably, the "meaning" of her death has [changed over time](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/03/10/a-call-for-help).


## Topics
We also briefly mentioned the following concepts and historical events:

* Here is some additional data on [mass incarceration](https://www.sentencingproject.org/criminal-justice-facts/), one of several societal responses to crime and drugs we discussed
* [Stop and Frisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop-and-frisk_in_New_York_City) - a policing program in New York City that was ruled unconstitutional, though there are [widespread allegations](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2017/08/stop-and-frisk-four-years-after-ruled-unconstitutional/537264/) that the program has been continued in a more limited way.
