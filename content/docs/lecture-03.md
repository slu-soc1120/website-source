## Middle Range Theory
Unlike "grand" theories that start with a theoretical idea and attempt to explain a large number of phenomena, ["mid-" or "middle-range theory"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-range_theory_(sociology)) attempts to address a concrete and relatively narrow empirical issue. The idea was put forth by [Robert K. Merton, Ph.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Merton) (1910-2003), who spent the majority of his career at Columbia University. The original idea was discussed in a 1949 paper called ["On Sociological Theories of the Middle Range."](http://www.csun.edu/~snk1966/Robert%20K%20Merton%20-%20On%20Sociological%20Theories%20of%20the%20Middle%20Range.pdf).

## Model for the Social Determiants of Health
The model presented in class was originally published by the National Academy of Sciences in a report called "Promoting Health: Intervention Strategies from Social and Behavioral Research." I call it the "Kaplan model" because it was featured in a 2004 article by a public health professor at the University of Michigan named George Kaplan. That article, titled ["Whatâ€™s Wrong with Social Epidemiology, and How Can We Make It Better?,"](https://academic.oup.com/epirev/article/26/1/124/384238) which discusses the both the strengths and the weakensses of these types of models.

## Slavery Hypertension Hypothesis
We discussed this briefly in class today, but if you want to learn a bit more about the lack of biomedical evidence for this, [this LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-may-17-oe-obasogie17-story.html) editorial from 2007 as well as [this blog post](http://raceandgenomics.ssrc.org/Kaufman/) from the Social Science Research Council. [This 2003 article from *Epidemiology*](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/Fulltext/2003/01000/The_Slavery_Hypertension_Hypothesis__Dissemination.27.aspx) provides a more detailed breakdown of the problems with the hypothesis.
