## Subjective Class Position
While it is possible to [calculate class membership using objective criteria](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/09/06/are-you-in-the-american-middle-class/), many Americans identify as "middle class" regardless of these more objective criteria, meaning that there is [a lot of variation in the "vast middle"](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2010/10/Four-middle-classes.pdf).

We briefly mentioned the following people:

* [Erik Olin Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Olin_Wright) (1947-2019) - American Sociologist and neo-Marxist philosopher, best known for his work on social class and stratification.
* [Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx) (1818-1883) - German philosopher, economist, and political theorist, best known for his association with communist political and economic thought.

## Topics
We also briefly mentioned the following concepts and historical events:

* [Harvard's adminissions lawsuit](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/us/harvard-affirmative-action-asian-americans.html?module=inline) - while a judge recently ruled that [Harvard does not discriminate](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/01/us/harvard-admissions-lawsuit.html) against Asian-American students, the lawsuit revealed that a large percentage of [white students](https://www.salon.com/2019/10/06/harvards-systemic-nepotism-revealed-43-percent-of-admitted-white-students-were-legacies/) gained access to the University without the same high educational achievements as other students. These patterns are part of a [wider way in which elite universities use legacy and athletic admissions](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/23/elite-schools-ivy-league-legacy-admissions-harvard-wealthier-whiter) to maintain access to education for a small but influential group of Americans.
