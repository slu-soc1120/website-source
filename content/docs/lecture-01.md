## Bob Dylan
[Bob Dylan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan) (b. 1941) is a singer-songwriter who became an icon of 1960s counter-cultural movements, in part due to the [political nature of some of his songs](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/the-political-bob-dylan). Among his enormous body of work are a number of songs focused on the civil rights era, including "[The Death of Emmett Till](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Emmett_Till)", "[Only a Pawn in Their Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_a_Pawn_in_Their_Game)", "[The Times They Are a-Changin'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_They_Are_a-Changin%27_(song))", and "[Blowin' in the Wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowin%27_in_the_Wind)".

## Emmett Till

## Norman Rockwell
Norman Rockwell (1894-1978) was an American painter, known for his generally popular (though often not critically acclaimed) portraits of mid-century American life. We discussed two of his paintings - [*Saying Grace*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saying_Grace_(Rockwell)) (1951) and [*The Problem We all Live With*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_We_All_Live_With) (1964), the latter of which captures four U.S. Marshals escorting [Ruby Bridges](#ruby-bridges) to elementary school in New Orleans during that city's school desegregation crisis. If you're ever in Western Massachusetts, you can stop and see the [Norman Rockwell Museum](http://www.nrm.org), dedicated to preserving his works and legacy.

## Ruby Bridges

## The Vietnam War
A long-running conflict, which the U.S. was involved in from November, 1955 through April, 1975. The war itself is a massive and contraverseal topic in the U.S. You can get a brief overview of the conflict [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War) and a more in-depth introduction with [Ken Burn's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Burns) 2017 documentary [*The Vietnam War*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vietnam_War_(TV_series)). I also recommend reading [Tim O'Brien's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_O%27Brien_(author)) books for an infantry soldier's literary perspective, and watching [*The Fog of War*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fog_of_War) for a political perspective on Secretary of Defense [Robert McNamara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McNamara).

## Other Figures
We also briefly mentioned:

* President [John F. Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy)
* Arkansas Gov. [George Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wallace), a segregationist who challenged LBJ in the [1964 Democratic primary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries)
