## Bernie Park
One of the most extreme examples of attempts to keep St. Louis's subrubs segregated is Bernie Park, a park in Creve Coeur, Missouri (a West St. Louis County suburb). An African American opthalmologist named Dr. Howard Phillip Venable (who was an instructor at SLU) was among a dozen African American homeowners who bought into the Spoede Meadows subdivision in the mid-1950s, when it was a largely white community. Creve Coeur bought out eleven of the black families, but Dr. Venable refused and the city subsequently used [eminent domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain) to seize his property. The park on these twelve plots of land was dedicated in 1961, named for the mayor who invoked eminent domain on Dr. Venable's home. There is [currently a movement](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/creve-coeur-park-named-for-ex-mayor-may-be-renamed/article_1bdb6234-573e-5f05-8cb9-c0d499321e3b.html) to rename Bernie Park for Dr. Venable.

## Deed Covenants
Racially restrictive langauge was added to many deeds (the legal paperwork that certifies home ownership) in the early 20th century. The lawsuit that ended their legal enforcement, [Shelley v. Kraemer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_v._Kraemer), began in 1945 after the Shelley family bought a home that had a covenant on its deed preventing African American ownership. The Supreme Court ruled in the Shelley family's favor, and the [house today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_House_(St._Louis,_Missouri)) is a U.S. National Historic Landmark.
