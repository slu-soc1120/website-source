## "Slum Clarence" in St. Louis
We discussed both the [Gateway Arch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Arch#Historical_background) and the [Mill Creek Valley](https://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/remembering-mill-creek-valley-once-home-20000-black-st-louisans#stream/0) as examples of the wholesale destruction of African American neighborhoods in the City of St. Louis. These were part of a pattern of urban renewal projects that affected [black institutions](https://www.stlmag.com/history/architecture/centers-of-community-that-were-destroyed-in-the-mill-creek-v/) in St. Louis.

## People
We briefly mentioned the following people:

* [Joseph Schumpeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Schumpeter) (1883-1950) - Austrian economist known for his idea of ["creative destruction"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction)


## Topics
We also briefly mentioned the following concepts and historical events:

* Index of dissimilarity, a statistical measure for describing segregation in cities. Recent data for the [City of St. Louis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RACEDISPARITY029510) and [St. Louis County](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RACEDISPARITY029189) are available from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank.
* [Neoliberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism) - economic movement associated with "free markets," fiscal austerity, and privatization.
