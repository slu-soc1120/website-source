## Alameda County Study
Some of the most important insights into population health in the late 20th century were obtained from data collected in and around Oakland, Calforina. The [Alameda County Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_County_Study) consisted of multiple waves of data collection that [yielded critical insights](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ792845.pdf) about health behaviors, culture, and outcomes.


## Cortisol and Stress
The documentary features a number of references to the impact that stress has on health outcomes. The [Robert Wood Johnson Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wood_Johnson_Foundation) has a great [brief](http://www.nmpha.org/Resources/Documents/RWJF%20Issue%20Brief%20-%20Stress%20_%20Health.pdf) that describes how stress is realted to the social determinants of health, and it also briefly describes cortisol's role.


## Excess Death
The idea of excess death or excess mortality is a way of quanitfying the burden of disparity in a society. Using statistical models, we can estimate how many people we expect to die in a given time period, and then subtract that from the observed number of deaths. This has been a common way of assessing the impact of a disease of interest on mortality, and has been used most widely in cancer epidemiology.


## Social Epidemiology
Social epidemiology is a branch of [epidemiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology), which is the science focused on studying the distribution of illness in a population. [Social epidemiologists](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2723602/pdf/12199_2008_Article_BF02898100.pdf) are particularly interested in how the [social determinants of health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_determinants_of_health) account for population health differences. Social epidemiologists are often trained in both sociology and public health.


## Whitehall Studies
Led by [Sir Michael Marmot, Ph.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Marmot), an epidemiologist at University College London, the [Whitehall Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall_Study) are long running public health project. The findings that have come out of this project, particularly about the gradient in socioeconomic status and power in the British civil service, have been foundational for social epidemiology.
