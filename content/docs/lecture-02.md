## Alameda County Study
Some of the most important insights into population health in the late 20th century were obtained from data collected in and around Oakland, Calforina. The [Alameda County Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_County_Study) consisted of multiple waves of data collection that [yielded critical insights](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ792845.pdf) about health behaviors, culture, and outcomes.

## Social Epidemiology
Social epidemiology is a branch of [epidemiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology), which is the science focused on studying the distribution of illness in a population. [Social epidemiologists](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2723602/pdf/12199_2008_Article_BF02898100.pdf) are particularly interested in how the [social determinants of health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_determinants_of_health) account for population health differences. Social epidemiologists are often trained in both sociology and public health.
