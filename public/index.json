We discussed two of his paintings - Saying Grace (1951) and The Problem We all Live With (1964), the latter of which captures four U.S. Marshals escorting Ruby Bridges to elementary school in New Orleans during that city\u0026rsquo;s school desegregation crisis. If you\u0026rsquo;re ever in Western Massachusetts, you can stop and see the Norman Rockwell Museum, dedicated to preserving his works and legacy.\nRuby Bridges The Vietnam War A long-running conflict, which the U.S. was involved in from November, 1955 through April, 1975. The war itself is a massive and contraverseal topic in the U.S. You can get a brief overview of the conflict on Wikipedia and a more in-depth introduction with Ken Burn\u0026rsquo;s 2017 documentary The Vietnam War. I also recommend reading Tim O\u0026rsquo;Brien\u0026rsquo;s books for an infantry soldier\u0026rsquo;s literary perspective, and watching The Fog of War for a political perspective on Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.\nOther Figures We also briefly mentioned:\n President John F.
