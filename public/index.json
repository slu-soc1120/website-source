Among his enormous body of work are a number of songs focused on the civil rights era, including \u0026ldquo;The Death of Emmett Till\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Only a Pawn in Their Game\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;The Times They Are a-Changin\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Blowin\u0026rsquo; in the Wind\u0026rdquo;.\n Video - It\u0026rsquo;s Alright Ma (I\u0026rsquo;m Only Bleeding)     Details:\n Lyrics Wikipedia Page  \nCensus Tract Census tracts are areas defined by the U.S. Census Bureau for data collection and dissemination. They can be virtually any size, but have a typical population of 4,000 people (so they\u0026rsquo;re often bigger in rural areas and smaller in cities). The Census Bureau has an excellent slide deck with some history and facts about the tracts.\n\nClassical Social Theory The \u0026ldquo;classical\u0026rdquo; theorists we mentioned this week were:\n Ã‰mile Durkheim (1858-1917) - French sociologist known for his work on mental health, religion, and the division of labor Karl Marx (1818-1883) - German philosopher, economist, and political theorist, best known for his association with communist political and economic thought Max Weber (1864-1920) - German sociologist with wide-ranging early influence on the sociology of religion, economics, organizations, and politics W.E.B. Du Bois (1868-1963) - one of the first American sociologists, known for his research on African American life  \nContemporary Social Theory The \u0026ldquo;contemporary\u0026rdquo; theorists we mentioned this week were:\n Antonio Gramsci (1891-1937) - a Marxist political and social theorist known for his articulation of praxis in the Prison Notebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_Notebooks) C. Wright Mills (1916-1962) - an American sociologist best known for his book The Sociological Imagination Michel Foucault (1926-1984) - a French philosopher best known for his work on power and knowledge, especially regarding prisons and medicine Patricia Hill Collins (b. 1948) - an American sociologist best known for her work on intersectionality and feminist theory Pierre Bourdieu (1930-2002) - a French philosopher and sociologist best known for his work on social and cultural capital  \nElizabeth Eckford Elizabeth Eckford (b. 1941) was one of the first students to desegregate Little Rock, Arkansas\u0026rsquo;s Central High School. Known as the \u0026ldquo;Little Rock Nine\u0026rdquo;, they faced protests and the Arkansas National Guard, who were called in to bar the students from the school. [President Eisenhower]() ultimately federalized the Arkansas National Guard and dispatched active duty soliders from the Army\u0026rsquo;s 101st Airborne Division to ensure the students were able to enter the school and attend classes. Eckford became well known because of a photo taken by journalist Will Counts on the first day of the students\u0026rsquo; effort to attend the High School. Counts\u0026rsquo;s photo of a white student named Hazel Bryan screaming at Eckford would become an iconic image. The two women briefly attempted to reconcile later in life, but ultimately found they were unable to.\n\nEmmett Till Emmett Till (1941-1955) was a young men from Chicago who was savagedly beaten and then shot before his body was dumped in the Tallahatchie River near Money, MS. His murder was retribution for Till\u0026rsquo;s alleged assault of a white women named Carolyn Bryant in a store. However, Bryant admitted in a 2008 interview for The Blood of Emmett Till (New York Times review) that the assault did not happen the way she claimed at the time. Bryant\u0026rsquo;s husband and his friend were charged with the murder and exonerated by an all white jury, but later admitted (protected by double jeopardy) that they had committed the crime. After The Blood of Emmett Till was published in 2017, the F.B.I. annouced that they were reopening the investigation into Till\u0026rsquo;s murder even though both men are now deceased. The case itself gained substantial national noteriety because Till\u0026rsquo;s mother insisted that photos of his mutiliated body be published.\nTill\u0026rsquo;s death is an example of lynching, which is commonly associated with hangings but actually refers to any planned extrajudicial (outside of the justice system) killing by a mob or group. Between the end of the Civil War and the Civil Rights era, lynching was a greusome, public way of enforcing white supremacy. At least 3,446 African Americans were lynched between 1882 and 1968. The Equal Justice Initiative\u0026rsquo;s interactive website includes a detailed report, a documentary, interviews, and an interactive map of where lynchings occured.\n\nHealth Care Spending The majority of data for the first \u0026ldquo;parable\u0026rdquo; were obtained via the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD; Wikipedia page). There are a total of 36 member states, primarily found in Europe and the Americas; there are no member states in Africa. As a group, they serve as a proxy for the world\u0026rsquo;s most developed economies. None of the so-called BRIC developing economies (Brazi, Russia, India, and China) are a part of it, though Brazil has applied.\nThe following OECD data were used in this lecture:\n Per capita health care spending in U.S. dollars, 2018 (data) Life expectancy at birth (years), 2018 (data) Infant mortality rates (deaths per 1,000 live births), 2018 (data) Gross domestic product, 2018 (data)  We also looked at a graph of how the probability of an infant dying by their first birthday grows over its first year at a steeper rate in the United States than elsewhere. This graph was originally published on the Washington Post\u0026rsquo;s Wonkblog.\n\nGross Domestic Product Gross domestic product, or GDP, is a measure that captures the value of goods and services produced in a particular place at a given time. We can calculate GDPs for states or countries, for example, in a given year. In this class, we\u0026rsquo;ll express GDP in per capita terms, so that we know the total dollar value per person of a given place\u0026rsquo;s economy.\n\nInfant Mortality Rate The number of deaths of children that occur prior to their first birthdays, divided by the total number of live births. This is almost always expressed as a per capita rate - the number of deaths per 1,000 live births. The word \u0026ldquo;mortality\u0026rdquo; is used in place of \u0026ldquo;death\u0026rdquo; frequently in scientific discussions.\n\nLead Poisoning Our second \u0026ldquo;parable\u0026rdquo; this week had to do with lead poisoning. If you want to learn a bit more about Flint, Michigan\u0026rsquo;s lead crisis, both The Guardian decisions and the New York Times have reported on it (this NYT story is where the map used in the lecture came from.\nThe data shown for St. Louis were obtained from Reuters\u0026rsquo; reporting on lead poisoning. Their article includes a fascinating (if a bit terrifying) interactive map of lead poisoning rates. The map includes many, but not all, American states.\nOther cities have struggled with this problem as well. As of August 2019, Newark is in the midst of a protracted contaminated water crisis that the city has only recently begun to acknowledge. Chicago has found high rates of lead in tap water due to contamination from lead service lines as well, and cities are working with state legislatures to allow them to proactively replace homeowners\u0026rsquo; lead water lines.\nLead posioning is an active area of scholarship as well, with recent papers reviewing our knowledge on lead posioning, documenting Flint\u0026rsquo;s water crisis, and tracing racial disparities.\n\nLife Expectancy When we discuss life expectancy, we typically are describing the number of years an infant should expect to live on average. The caveat is that we expect death rates not to change when we make this calculation, and we do not know cohort-specific death rates in advance. So, a change in history (for example, a war or a pandemic) will dramatically alter the actual life expectancy of particular groups (cohorts) in society. Nevertheless, this is a useful way to compare general levels of population health - healthier, safer societies have higher average life expectancy at birth.\n\nThe Lovings Mildred Loving (d. 2008) and Richard Loving (d. 1975) were the plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the State of Virgina challenging the state\u0026rsquo;s Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which banned interracial marriage (these were called \u0026ldquo;anti-miscegenation laws\u0026rdquo;). The Lovings had been charged under this statute in 1958, and subsequently sued Virginia. Their lawsuit went to the Supreme Court, which ruled in Loving v. Virginia (1968) that these laws violated the U.S. Constitution\u0026rsquo;s Equal Protection Clause, a part of the 14th Amendment.\n\nNorman Rockwell Norman Rockwell (1894-1978) was an American painter, known for his generally popular (though often not critically acclaimed) portraits of mid-century American life. His work was featured for nearly fifty years on the covers of The Saturday Evening Post. We discussed two of his paintings - Saying Grace (1951) and The Problem We all Live With (1964), the latter of which captures four U.S. Marshals escorting Ruby Bridges to elementary school in New Orleans during that city\u0026rsquo;s school desegregation crisis. If you\u0026rsquo;re ever in Western Massachusetts, you can stop and see the Norman Rockwell Museum, dedicated to preserving his works and legacy.\n\nPer Capita Statistics The term \u0026ldquo;per capita\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;per person.\u0026rdquo; Calculating statistics on a per capita basis is particularly important, since larger countries should, for example, be expected to spend more in total than smaller countries (an example we looked at this week using OECD data). When we calculate something per person, we remove any inherent bias due to total population size. To do this, we divide the value of interest by the total population (i.e. the total health care dollars spent by total population). We may find that larger countries still spend more per person, but we are only able to make a valid comparison because we\u0026rsquo;ve converted our numbers appropriately. We\u0026rsquo;ll use per capita statistics frequently in this class as we make comparisons across neighborhoods, cities, states, and countries.\n\nRates Rates are another extremely important statistical concept that we\u0026rsquo;ll use frequently this semester, because they put often very large or very small numbers in greater context. We used rates this week to compare infant mortality across countries. A country with a large number of births would also be expected to have a higher number of babies who die before their first birthdays. To compenstate for this, comparisons are made using infant mortality rate. To calculate a rate in this case, we divide the total number of deaths by the total number of live births. A rate is always calculated this way, taking the number of occurences and dividing it by total number of possibly affected people.\n\nRates Per Capita In order to compare rates across neighborhoods, cities, states, or countries, use utilize per capita statistics. When we calculate a \u0026ldquo;rate per capita\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;per capita rate,\u0026rdquo; we take our rate and multiply it by a set number of individuals. This helps us ensure that our rates are expressed relative to the size of the population they describe. For example, we typically calculate infant mortality rate by multiplying a given entity\u0026rsquo;s rate by 1,000. In the United States, we typically calculate per capita crime rates by taking a city\u0026rsquo;s or state\u0026rsquo;s rate, and multiplying it by 100,000. Like the other statistical calculations discussed this week, we do this because it helps facilitate more valid comparisons between like things.\n\nRuby Bridges Ruby Bridges (b. 1954) was the first African American child to desegregate an all white elementary school in New Orleans. Her daily walk to school with an escort of U.S. Marshalls was memorialized in Norman Rockwell\u0026rsquo;s 1964 painting The Problem We all Live With. Her attendance at the school was difficult for her and her family - she spent all of the first year and part of the second alone in a classroom with a teacher, and the family suffered a number of consequential setbacks due to their notoriety.\n\nThe Stroke Belt The third parable for this week was about America\u0026rsquo;s stroke belt. The data we saw on the slides came from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The academic literature on the stroke belt has expanded in the last few years, led by Maria Glymour, Ph.D., an epidemiologist at UCSF. She has documented increased risk of stroke on top of pre-existing disparities in stroke risk for both race and childhood poverty. Glymour\u0026rsquo;s work has also found elevated risk for individuals who are born in these states as well as individuals who live in them during adulthood. However, there is still quite a bit we don\u0026rsquo;t know about why stroke rates are higher here (and there are some areas within these states where rates are lower).\n\nThe Vietnam War A long-running conflict, which the U.S. was involved in from November, 1955 through April, 1975. The war itself is a massive and contraverseal topic in the U.S. You can get a brief overview of the conflict on Wikipedia and a more in-depth introduction with Ken Burn\u0026rsquo;s 2017 documentary The Vietnam War. I also recommend reading Tim O\u0026rsquo;Brien\u0026rsquo;s books for an infantry soldier\u0026rsquo;s literary perspective, and watching The Fog of War for a political perspective on Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. The Vietnam Memorial in Washington D.C. is a striking and sobering part of our National Parks system. If you can\u0026rsquo;t make it to D.C., there is a full scale replica just an hour and a half south of St. Louis at Missouri\u0026rsquo;s National Veterans Memorial in Perryville, MO.\n\nOther People We also briefly mentioned the following people:\n President Dwight D. Eisenhower (1890-1969), the 34th President of the United States as well as a retired Army General and former NATO commander President John F. Kennedy (1917-1963), the 35th President of the United States as well as a former Congressmen and Senator for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts President Jimmy Carter (b. 1924), the 39th President of the United States, whose 1976 convention speech quoted Bob Dylan\u0026rsquo;s song \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s Alright Ma (I\u0026rsquo;m Only Bleeding)\u0026rdquo; Arkansas Gov. George Wallace (1919-1998), a segregationist who challenged LBJ in the 1964 Democratic primary (among other unsuccessful Presidential runs) Chef, author, and travel documentary maker Anthony Bourdian (1956-2018) Civil rights leader Malcom X (1925-1965), an outspoken activist in the Nation of Islam who was murdered by three members of the Nation in 1965 after publicly feuding with its leadership Civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., whose legacy as a non-violent protester (think not just of Selma but also the 1963 \u0026ldquo;I Have a Dream\u0026rdquo; speech) belies the harsh, direct criticism King made of segregation, inequality, and American militarism Lee Harvey Oswald (1939-1963), assassinated President Kennedy and murdered Dallas Police Officer J.D. Tippet Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (1925-2013), mentioned here for her well-known denial of society\u0026rsquo;s importance in a 1987 interview  \nOther Topics We also briefly mentioned the following concepts and historical events:\n Gab, an alt-right social media platform Healthy People 2020, a Federal government campaign to improve population health The Birmingham Campaign, the 1963 effort to effect change in one of America\u0026rsquo;s most segregated cities The Cuban Missle Crisis (1962) The Civil Rights Act (1964) The Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955, a campaign sparked by Rosa Park\u0026rsquo;s arrest to force desegregation of the city\u0026rsquo;s public transportation system The Selma Marches in 1965, which gained national attention due to the brutal beating of marchers by Alabama State Police officers The Voting Rights Act (1965), which created nationwide protections to ensure all Americans could vote regardless of racial identity The Watts riots (1965), which were sparked after Los Angeles Police stopped and questioned a young African American man. A fight broke out at the scene, and wild rumors spread quickly that lead to widespready violece breaking out.
