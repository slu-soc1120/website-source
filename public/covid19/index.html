    <div class="article-style" itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>I know a lot of you are worried about your coursework. How can you make the switch to distance learning overnight if you have no practice in it and don’t even know what it means? What if you found comfort and meaning in class discussions and that’s gone now? Will your grades suffer with the shift to online teaching? How will you complete assignments?</p>
<p>My goal for this page is to clarify, at least for the context of SOC 1120-02 and 02H, how things are going to change. I hope doing so reduces some of the ambiguity and stress related to this class and the rest of the semester.</p>
<h2 id="focusing-on-what-matters">Focusing on What Matters</h2>
<p>First, though, I think it is important to acknowledge the current situation we are all collectively facing outside of coursework. I assume that all of us are worried about lots of other things, too. This other stuff is huge, existential stuff - the still unknown scale of the CVOID-19 pandemic, the specter of a recession worse than the 2008 one, and the day-to-day unknown of when our lives will return to &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; We’re literally worrying about our physical survival, our mental health, our family’s and friends’ lives, and maybe our family’s finances. Our lives have all been dramatically disrupted almost overnight. Some of us are still working, some of us are taking care of children or older adults, some of us are struggling to make ends meet. We should be honest with ourselves - this is an incredibly significant, stressful, and life-altering event we are all collectively experiencing.</p>
<p><strong>All of this takes precedence over a semester’s worth of college classes.</strong> I want to make clear that we should not and cannot continue with coursework as though things are the same, but just online now. We can’t ignore the fact that we are living in a moment of uncertainty and crisis. This means we have to be kind to ourselves and each other. It also means all of us, but especially faculty, need drastically re-calibrate our expectations for what we will learn and achieve in courses this semester. This is important because (1) it’s just true (2) our mental health will suffer if we don’t acknowledge this and try to go on as if everything is normal.</p>
<h2 id="office-hours">Office Hours</h2>
<p>One way in which I am going try and achieve some semblence of normalcy will be remaining available to you in variety of ways. My office hours will remain the same - Tuesdays, 9am to 11am by <a href="https://calendly.com/chris-prener">appointment only</a> and 11am to 12pm. These will all occur via Zoom. If you sign-up for an appointment, I&rsquo;ll email you a link for our Zoom meeting. Details on the drop-in Zoom hour will be available via Google Classroom. Please feel free to stop by as often as you would like, and we can use a breakout room if necessary to speak privately. As always, I&rsquo;ll also remain responsive over email and Google Classroom.</p>
<h2 id="policy-changes">Policy Changes</h2>
<p>Outside of office hours, how will this reality affect our class? I’m making some changes to what you’ll be expected to do and how you’ll be evaluated. My goal is to give you the opportunity to keep learning and engaging with me and each other, but without feeling that the class is a source of stress in your life now. The goal of these changes is to minimize your anxiety and stress while maximizing your opportunity to learn and stay engaged in our learning community.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>There will be no second half participation grade.</strong> Everyone will receive full credit in that column, and I will no longer collect attendance. That said, coming to class remains an important part of the course. I will record class sessions using Zoom, but I can&rsquo;t guarantee they will work every time. It is also important to establish a routine for yourself, and to find ways to see other people even if it is only virtually. We&rsquo;re going to all get a lot less interaction with other people than we&rsquo;re used to, and so getting up and spending a little time engaged in coursework is going to be beneficial for our mental health.</li>
<li><strong>Class meetings will occur via Zoom, and will be shorter.</strong> We will continue to meet Mondays and Wednesdays at 2:10pm Central Time via Zoom. You will all receive an email shortly with an invitation that will be good for the remainder of the semester. We will conclude class around 3pm each day instead of the scheduled 3:25pm time. Recordings and class materials will continue to be made available via Google Classroom.</li>
<li><strong>There will be no more readings from Anderson.</strong> We&rsquo;ll still have some readings from peer-reviewed journal articles, however.</li>
<li><strong>There will be no second exam.</strong> This was scheduled for March 23rd, but given the circumstances I am going to give everyone full credit.</li>
<li><strong>QHQ assignments will be modified.</strong> Instead of a three page paper, please turn in an outline with three parts:
<ol>
<li>Your question and hypothesis, each 1 sentence in length,</li>
<li>ten supporting points, each a 1-3 sentences in length, that outline key parts of your chapter and how they inform your thinking on your question/hypothesis,</li>
<li>and a concluding question, also one sentence in length.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>QHQ discussions will occur via Zoom.</strong> We&rsquo;ll run these the same way - I&rsquo;ll move all of you into virtual breakout rooms for discussions, and then we&rsquo;ll all return for some final discussion as a large group. These will occur on April 8th and April 29th <em>as scheduled</em>. Papers will be due before this session. These sessions may go a bit longer, so please give yourself until 3:15pm on these two days.</li>
<li><strong>Two documentaries will be required viewing.</strong> These will both be available via streaming from Pius Library.</li>
<li><strong>A exam will still be given during finals week.</strong> This will be similar to our in-class exams, except that they will occur over Google Forms (for some multiple choice questions) and Google Docs (for a short answer question). This will be timed, and will be facilitated via Google Classroom. The exam will be based on the course meeting materials, the two documentaries, and the remaining readings. It will only cover material starting on March 25th through the last class on May 4th.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am also making the following changes to the honors section:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seminar 3 will be rescheduled.</strong> We will meet to discuss extra readings on Gender, Sexuality, and Health during the week of April 20th. However, there will not be a response paper assignment. I will send out a Doodle during the week of March 23rd to schedule this meeting.</li>
<li><strong>The Op-Ed assignment will proceed as planned.</strong> Please continue to work on your writing assignment over the next few weeks and submit a draft by April 15th. The final submission, including to a publication, should be made by May 4th.</li>
<li><strong>Seminar 4 will proceed as planned on May 5th to discuss your op-eds.</strong> This will occur via Zoom.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-happens-if-i-get-sick">What Happens If I Get Sick?</h2>
<p>If you become unwell, or find yourself taking care of your family or friends, please let me know as soon as possible! Even though I am not taking attendance, I want to make sure students are all well prepared for the exam. I also want to make sure that the modified QHQ assignments are completed. If &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; is a few days after a deadline, that is OK. If you need to re-schedule the third exam, that is OK too. I will not ask for documentation, since if you&rsquo;re sick but not <em>very</em> sick, the last thing most you will want to do is go to a doctor just to get a note. I am proceeding with a spirit of trust in all of you, and ask you reciprocate that with me.</p>
<h2 id="provisos">Provisos</h2>
<p>This is my plan as of March 19th, 2020. I may modify it further as we progress through the remainder of the semester. If I become sick or a member of my family becomes ill, further modifications will likely be required. I will do my best to keep everyone updated in a timely fashion. Please check your email and Google Classroom regularly. I appreciate everyone&rsquo;s willingness to roll with the many punches we are all facing right now. Remember, we are in this together.</p>
