&lt;h2 id=&#34;alameda-county-study&#34;&gt;Alameda County Study&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the most important insights into population health in the late 20th century were obtained from data collected in and around Oakland, Calforina. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_County_Study&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Alameda County Study&lt;/a&gt; consisted of multiple waves of data collection that &lt;a href=&#34;https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ792845.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;yielded critical insights&lt;/a&gt; about health behaviors, culture, and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-epidemiology&#34;&gt;Social Epidemiology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social epidemiology is a branch of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;, which is the science focused on studying the distribution of illness in a population. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2723602/pdf/12199_2008_Article_BF02898100.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Social epidemiologists&lt;/a&gt; are particularly interested in how the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_determinants_of_health&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;social determinants of health&lt;/a&gt; account for population health differences. Social epidemiologists are often trained in both sociology and public health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-people&#34;&gt;Other People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also briefly mentioned the following people:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://scholar.harvard.edu/davidrwilliams/home&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;David Williams, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt; - sociologist and public health professor at Harvard University&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/66763&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Margarita Alegria, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt; - professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nancy-krieger/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Nancy Krieger&lt;/a&gt; - social epidemiologist at Harvard&amp;rsquo;s School of Public Health&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bob-dylan&#34;&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/a&gt; (b. 1941) is a singer-songwriter who became an icon of 1960s counter-cultural movements, in part due to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/the-political-bob-dylan&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;political nature of some of his songs&lt;/a&gt;. Among his enormous body of work are a number of songs focused on the civil rights era, including &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Emmett_Till&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Death of Emmett Till&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_a_Pawn_in_Their_Game&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Only a Pawn in Their Game&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_They_Are_a-Changin%27_(song)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Times They Are a-Changin&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowin%27_in_the_Wind&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Blowin&amp;rsquo; in the Wind&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;census-tract&#34;&gt;Census Tract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Census tracts are areas defined by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.census.gov&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;U.S. Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt; for data collection and dissemination. They can be virtually any size, but have a typical population of 4,000 people (so they&amp;rsquo;re often bigger in rural areas and smaller in cities). The Census Bureau has an excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/education/CensusTracts.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;slide deck&lt;/a&gt; with some history and facts about the tracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;classical-social-theory&#34;&gt;Classical Social Theory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;classical&amp;rdquo; theorists we mentioned this week were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Émile_Durkheim&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Émile Durkheim&lt;/a&gt; (1858-1917) - French sociologist known for his work on mental health, religion, and the division of labor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Karl Marx&lt;/a&gt; (1818-1883) - German philosopher, economist, and political theorist, best known for his association with communist political and economic thought&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Max Weber&lt;/a&gt; (1864-1920) - German sociologist with wide-ranging early influence on the sociology of religion, economics, organizations, and politics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._B._Du_Bois&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;W.E.B. Du Bois&lt;/a&gt; (1868-1963) - one of the first American sociologists, known for his research on African American life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;contemporary-social-theory&#34;&gt;Contemporary Social Theory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;contemporary&amp;rdquo; theorists we mentioned this week were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Antonio Gramsci&lt;/a&gt; (1891-1937) - a Marxist political and social theorist known for his articulation of praxis in the &lt;em&gt;Prison Notebooks&lt;/em&gt;](&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_Notebooks&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_Notebooks&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Wright_Mills&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;C. Wright Mills&lt;/a&gt; (1916-1962) - an American sociologist best known for his book &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sociological_Imagination&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sociological Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Michel Foucault&lt;/a&gt; (1926-1984) - a French philosopher best known for his work on power and knowledge, especially regarding prisons and medicine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Hill_Collins&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Patricia Hill Collins&lt;/a&gt; (b. 1948) - an American sociologist best known for her work on intersectionality and feminist theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Bourdieu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pierre Bourdieu&lt;/a&gt; (1930-2002) - a French philosopher and sociologist best known for his work on social and cultural capital&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;elizabeth-eckford&#34;&gt;Elizabeth Eckford&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Eckford&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Elizabeth Eckford&lt;/a&gt; (b. 1941) was one of the first students to desegregate Little Rock, Arkansas&amp;rsquo;s Central High School. Known as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Rock_Nine&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Little Rock Nine&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, they faced protests and the Arkansas National Guard, who were called in to bar the students from the school. [President Eisenhower]() ultimately &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_National_Guard_and_the_integration_of_Central_High_School&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;federalized the Arkansas National Guard&lt;/a&gt; and dispatched active duty soliders from the Army&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101st_Airborne_Division&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;101st Airborne Division&lt;/a&gt; to ensure the students were able to enter the school and attend classes. Eckford became well known because of a photo taken by journalist Will Counts on the first day of the students&amp;rsquo; effort to attend the High School. Counts&amp;rsquo;s photo of a white student named Hazel Bryan screaming at Eckford &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.history.com/news/the-story-behind-the-famous-little-rock-nine-scream-image&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;would become an iconic image&lt;/a&gt;. The two women briefly attempted to reconcile later in life, but ultimately found they were unable to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;emmett-till&#34;&gt;Emmett Till&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmett_Till&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Emmett Till&lt;/a&gt; (1941-1955) was a young men from Chicago who was savagedly beaten and then shot before his body was dumped in the Tallahatchie River near Money, MS. His murder was retribution for Till&amp;rsquo;s alleged assault of a white women named Carolyn Bryant in a store. However, Bryant admitted in a 2008 interview for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Blood-of-Emmett-Till/Timothy-B-Tyson/9781476714851&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Blood of Emmett Till&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/books/review/blood-of-emmett-till-timothy-b-tyson.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;New York Times review&lt;/a&gt;) that the assault did not happen the way she claimed at the time. Bryant&amp;rsquo;s husband and his friend were charged with the murder and exonerated by an all white jury, but later admitted (protected by double jeopardy) that they had committed the crime. After &lt;em&gt;The Blood of Emmett Till&lt;/em&gt; was published in 2017, the F.B.I. annouced that they were &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npr.org/2018/07/12/628425530/justice-department-re-opens-emmett-till-murder-investigation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;reopening the investigation into Till&amp;rsquo;s murder&lt;/a&gt; even though both men are now deceased. The case itself gained substantial national noteriety because Till&amp;rsquo;s mother insisted that photos of his mutiliated body be published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Till&amp;rsquo;s death is an example of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;lynching&lt;/a&gt;, which is commonly associated with hangings but actually refers to any planned extrajudicial (outside of the justice system) killing by a mob or group. Between the end of the Civil War and the Civil Rights era, lynching &lt;a href=&#34;https://lynchinginamerica.eji.org/report/#lynching-in-america&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;was a greusome, public way of enforcing white supremacy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.naacp.org/history-of-lynchings/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;At least 3,446 African Americans were lynched between 1882 and 1968.&lt;/a&gt; The Equal Justice Initiative&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://lynchinginamerica.eji.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;interactive website&lt;/a&gt; includes a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lynchinginamerica.eji.org/report/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;detailed report&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://lynchinginamerica.eji.org/watch&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://lynchinginamerica.eji.org/listen&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;interviews&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=&#34;https://lynchinginamerica.eji.org/explore&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;interactive map&lt;/a&gt; of where lynchings occured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;health-care-spending&#34;&gt;Health Care Spending&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of data for the first &amp;ldquo;parable&amp;rdquo; were obtained via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oecd.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development&lt;/a&gt; (OECD; &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;). There are a total of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oecd.org/about/members-and-partners/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;36 member states&lt;/a&gt;, primarily found in Europe and the Americas; there are no member states in Africa. As a group, they serve as a proxy for the world&amp;rsquo;s most developed economies. None of the so-called BRIC developing economies (Brazi, Russia, India, and China) are a part of it, though Brazil has applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following OECD data were used in this lecture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#per-capita&#34;&gt;Per capita&lt;/a&gt; health care spending in U.S. dollars, 2018 (&lt;a href=&#34;https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#life-expectancy&#34;&gt;Life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; at birth (years), 2018 (&lt;a href=&#34;https://data.oecd.org/healthstat/life-expectancy-at-birth.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#infant-mortality-rate&#34;&gt;Infant mortality&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#rates&#34;&gt;rates&lt;/a&gt; (deaths per 1,000 live births), 2018 (&lt;a href=&#34;https://data.oecd.org/healthstat/infant-mortality-rates.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#gross-domestic-product&#34;&gt;Gross domestic product&lt;/a&gt;, 2018 (&lt;a href=&#34;https://data.oecd.org/gdp/gross-domestic-product-gdp.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the code used to turn these four tables into the plots we saw &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/slu-soc1120/OECD_OUTCOMES_Mortality&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;is available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also looked at a graph of how the probability of an infant dying by their first birthday grows over its first year at a steeper rate in the United States than elsewhere. This graph was originally published on the Washington Post&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/29/our-infant-mortality-rate-is-a-national-embarrassment/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wonkblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;gross-domestic-product&#34;&gt;Gross Domestic Product&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gross domestic product&lt;/a&gt;, or GDP, is a measure that captures the value of goods and services produced in a particular place at a given time. We can calculate GDPs for states or countries, for example, in a given year. In this class, we&amp;rsquo;ll express GDP in &lt;a href=&#34;#per-capita&#34;&gt;per capita&lt;/a&gt; terms, so that we know the total dollar value &lt;em&gt;per person&lt;/em&gt; of a given place&amp;rsquo;s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;infant-mortality-rate&#34;&gt;Infant Mortality Rate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of deaths of children that occur prior to their first birthdays, divided by the total number of live births. This is almost always expressed as a &lt;a href=&#34;#rates-per-capita&#34;&gt;per capita rate&lt;/a&gt; - the number of deaths per 1,000 live births. The word &amp;ldquo;mortality&amp;rdquo; is used in place of &amp;ldquo;death&amp;rdquo; frequently in scientific discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lead-poisoning&#34;&gt;Lead Poisoning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our second &amp;ldquo;parable&amp;rdquo; this week had to do with lead poisoning. Lead was commonly &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/leaded-gas-poison-invented-180961368/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;added to gasoline&lt;/a&gt; to improve engine efficiency and to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lead-paint/lead-laden-paint-still-widely-sold-around-the-world-idUSTRE57O64G20090825&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;paint&lt;/a&gt; to improve durability. Leaded paint was banned in 1978, lead in pipes in and solder/flux in 1986, and leaded gasoline was finally phased out in 1995, even though &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/leaded-gas-poison-invented-180961368/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;scientists knew throughout the 20th century&lt;/a&gt; that lead was highly toxic (though companies involved in lead production denied its toxicity publicly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn a bit more about &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Flint, Michigan&amp;rsquo;s lead crisis&lt;/a&gt;, both &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/03/nothing-to-worry-about-the-water-is-fine-how-flint-michigan-poisoned-its-people&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Guardian decisions&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/04/us/flint-water-lead-maps.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; have reported on it (this NYT story is where the map used in the lecture came from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data shown for St. Louis were obtained from Reuters&amp;rsquo; reporting on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-lead-testing/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;lead poisoning&lt;/a&gt;. Their article includes a fascinating (if a bit terrifying) &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reuters.com/investigates/graphics/lead-water/en/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;interactive map&lt;/a&gt; of lead poisoning rates. The map includes many, but not all, American states.

&lt;p&gt;Other cities have struggled with this problem as well, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2018/0827/US-cities-push-to-remove-lead-pipes-but-some-property-owners-resist&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cost and a patchwork of laws are barriers to proactively addressing lead water lines and paint&lt;/a&gt;. As of August 2019, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wsj.com/articles/newark-distributes-bottled-water-after-lead-contamination-found-11565650213&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Newark&lt;/a&gt; is in the midst of a protracted contaminated water crisis that the city has only recently begun to acknowledge. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-met-rahm-emanuel-lead-pipe-replacement-study-20181101-story.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; has found high rates of lead in tap water due to contamination from lead service lines as well, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lead-wars-public-health-vs-private-property_b_5b7ebd72e4b0682df5ac7baf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cities are working with state legislatures&lt;/a&gt; to allow them to proactively replace homeowners&amp;rsquo; lead water lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lead posioning is an active area of scholarship as well, with recent papers &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.med.55.091902.103653&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;reviewing our knowledge on lead posioning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2015.303003&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;documenting Flint&amp;rsquo;s water crisis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/du-bois-review-social-science-research-on-race/article/racial-ecology-of-lead-poisoning/F39AF4724258606DCC1CDA369DC08707&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tracing racial disparities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;life-expectancy&#34;&gt;Life Expectancy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we discuss life expectancy, we typically are describing the number of years an infant should expect to live &lt;em&gt;on average&lt;/em&gt;. The caveat is that we expect death rates not to change when we make this calculation, and we do not know cohort-specific death rates in advance. So, a change in history (for example, a war or a pandemic) will dramatically alter the actual life expectancy of particular groups (cohorts) in society. Nevertheless, this is a useful way to compare general levels of population health - healthier, safer societies have higher average life expectancy at birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-lovings&#34;&gt;The Lovings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mildred Loving (d. 2008) and Richard Loving (d. 1975) were the plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the State of Virgina challenging the state&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_Integrity_Act_of_1924&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Racial Integrity Act of 1924&lt;/a&gt;, which banned interracial marriage (these were called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-miscegenation_laws_in_the_United_States&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;anti-miscegenation laws&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;). The Lovings had been charged under this statute in 1958, and subsequently sued Virginia. Their lawsuit went to the Supreme Court, which ruled in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Loving v. Virginia&lt;/a&gt; (1968) that these laws violated the U.S. Constitution&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Equal Protection Clause, a part of the 14th Amendment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;norman-rockwell&#34;&gt;Norman Rockwell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Rockwell&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Norman Rockwell&lt;/a&gt; (1894-1978) was an American painter, known for his generally popular (though often not critically acclaimed) portraits of mid-century American life. His work was featured for nearly fifty years on the covers of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saturday_Evening_Post&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Saturday Evening Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We discussed two of his paintings - &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saying_Grace_(Rockwell)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saying Grace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1951) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_We_All_Live_With&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Problem We all Live With&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1964), the latter of which captures four U.S. Marshals escorting &lt;a href=&#34;#ruby-bridges&#34;&gt;Ruby Bridges&lt;/a&gt; to elementary school in New Orleans during that city&amp;rsquo;s school desegregation crisis. If you&amp;rsquo;re ever in Western Massachusetts, you can stop and see the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nrm.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Norman Rockwell Museum&lt;/a&gt;, dedicated to preserving his works and legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;per-capita-statistics&#34;&gt;Per Capita Statistics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;per capita&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;per person.&amp;rdquo; Calculating statistics on a per capita basis is particularly important, since larger countries should, for example, be expected to spend more in total than smaller countries (an example we looked at this week using &lt;a href=&#34;#health-care-spending&#34;&gt;OECD data&lt;/a&gt;). When we calculate something per person, we remove any inherent bias due to total population size. To do this, we divide the value of interest by the total population (i.e. the total health care dollars spent by total population). We may find that larger countries still spend more &lt;em&gt;per person,&lt;/em&gt; but we are only able to make a valid comparison because we&amp;rsquo;ve converted our numbers appropriately. We&amp;rsquo;ll use per capita statistics frequently in this class as we make comparisons across neighborhoods, cities, states, and countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;rates&#34;&gt;Rates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rates are another extremely important statistical concept that we&amp;rsquo;ll use frequently this semester, because they put often very large or very small numbers in greater context. We used rates this week to compare &lt;a href=&#34;#health-care-spending&#34;&gt;infant mortality&lt;/a&gt; across countries. A country with a large number of births would also be expected to have a higher number of babies who die before their first birthdays. To compenstate for this, comparisons are made using &lt;a href=&#34;#infant-mortality-rate&#34;&gt;infant mortality rate&lt;/a&gt;. To calculate a rate in this case, we divide the total number of deaths by the total number of live births. A rate is always calculated this way, taking the number of occurences and dividing it by total number of possibly affected people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;rates-per-capita&#34;&gt;Rates Per Capita&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to compare &lt;a href=&#34;#rates&#34;&gt;rates&lt;/a&gt; across neighborhoods, cities, states, or countries, use utilize &lt;a href=&#34;#per-capita-statistics&#34;&gt;per capita statistics&lt;/a&gt;. When we calculate a &amp;ldquo;rate per capita&amp;rdquo; or a &amp;ldquo;per capita rate,&amp;rdquo; we take our rate and multiply it by a set number of individuals. This helps us ensure that our rates are expressed relative to the size of the population they describe. For example, we typically calculate &lt;a href=&#34;#infant-mortality-rate&#34;&gt;infant mortality rate&lt;/a&gt; by multiplying a given entity&amp;rsquo;s rate by 1,000. In the United States, we typically calculate per capita crime rates by taking a city&amp;rsquo;s or state&amp;rsquo;s rate, and multiplying it by 100,000. Like the other statistical calculations discussed this week, we do this because it helps facilitate more valid comparisons between like things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ruby-bridges&#34;&gt;Ruby Bridges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Bridges&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ruby Bridges&lt;/a&gt; (b. 1954) was the first African American child to desegregate an all white elementary school in New Orleans. Her daily walk to school with an escort of U.S. Marshalls was memorialized in &lt;a href=&#34;#norman-rockwell&#34;&gt;Norman Rockwell&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; 1964 painting &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_We_All_Live_With&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Problem We all Live With&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Her attendance at the school was difficult for her and her family - she spent all of the first year and part of the second alone in a classroom with a teacher, and the family suffered a number of consequential setbacks due to their notoriety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-stroke-belt&#34;&gt;The Stroke Belt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third parable for this week was about America&amp;rsquo;s stroke belt. The data we saw on the slides came from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/maps_data.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Centers for Disease Control (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;ve shared the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/slu-soc1120/US_OUTCOMES_Stroke&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;maps and the code used to make them&lt;/a&gt;. The academic literature on the stroke belt has expanded in the last few years, led by &lt;a href=&#34;https://profiles.ucsf.edu/maria.glymour&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Maria Glymour, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist at UCSF. She has documented increased risk of stroke on top of pre-existing disparities in stroke risk for both &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1047279708002986&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;race and childhood poverty&lt;/a&gt;. Glymour&amp;rsquo;s work has also found elevated risk for individuals who are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.482059&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;born in these states&lt;/a&gt; as well as individuals who &lt;a href=&#34;https://n.neurology.org/content/73/22/1858.short&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;live in them during adulthood&lt;/a&gt;. However, there is still quite a bit we don&amp;rsquo;t know about why stroke rates are higher here (and there are some areas within these states where &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.012997&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;rates are lower&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-vietnam-war&#34;&gt;The Vietnam War&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long-running conflict, which the U.S. was involved in from November, 1955 through April, 1975. The war itself is a massive and contraverseal topic in the U.S. You can get a brief overview of the conflict &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and a more in-depth introduction with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Burns&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ken Burn&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; 2017 documentary &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vietnam_War_(TV_series)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vietnam War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I also recommend reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_O%27Brien_(author)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tim O&amp;rsquo;Brien&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; books for an infantry soldier&amp;rsquo;s literary perspective, and watching &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fog_of_War&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fog of War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a political perspective on Secretary of Defense &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McNamara&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Robert McNamara&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans_Memorial&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Vietnam Memorial&lt;/a&gt; in Washington D.C. is a striking and sobering part of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nps.gov/vive/index.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;National Parks system&lt;/a&gt;. If you can&amp;rsquo;t make it to D.C., there is a full scale replica just an hour and a half south of St. Louis at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mnvmfund.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Missouri&amp;rsquo;s National Veterans Memorial&lt;/a&gt; in Perryville, MO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-people&#34;&gt;Other People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also briefly mentioned the following people:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;President &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jimmy Carter&lt;/a&gt; (b. 1924), the 39th President of the United States, whose 1976 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/our-nations-past-and-future-address-accepting-the-presidential-nomination-the-democratic&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;convention speech&lt;/a&gt; quoted &lt;a href=&#34;#bob-dylan&#34;&gt;Bob Dylan&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; song &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Alright Ma (I&amp;rsquo;m Only Bleeding)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arkansas Gov. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wallace&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;George Wallace&lt;/a&gt; (1919-1998), a segregationist who challenged LBJ in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;1964 Democratic primary&lt;/a&gt; (among other unsuccessful Presidential runs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chef, author, and travel documentary maker &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Bourdain&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Anthony Bourdian&lt;/a&gt; (1956-2018)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Lee Harvey Oswald&lt;/a&gt; (1939-1963), assassinated President Kennedy and murdered Dallas Police Officer &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Tippit&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;J.D.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-topics&#34;&gt;Other Topics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also briefly mentioned the following concepts and historical events:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gab_(social_network)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gab&lt;/a&gt;, an alt-right social media platform&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. &lt;strong&gt;Adapted Material&lt;/strong&gt; means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. &lt;strong&gt;Adapter&amp;rsquo;s License&lt;/strong&gt; means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c. &lt;strong&gt;Copyright and Similar Rights&lt;/strong&gt; means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;d. &lt;strong&gt;Effective Technological Measures&lt;/strong&gt; means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e. &lt;strong&gt;Exceptions and Limitations&lt;/strong&gt; means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;f. &lt;strong&gt;Licensed Material&lt;/strong&gt; means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;g. &lt;strong&gt;Licensed Rights&lt;/strong&gt; means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;h. &lt;strong&gt;Licensor&lt;/strong&gt; means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i. &lt;strong&gt;Share&lt;/strong&gt; means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;j. &lt;strong&gt;Sui Generis Database Rights&lt;/strong&gt; means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;k. &lt;strong&gt;You&lt;/strong&gt; means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-2-scope&#34;&gt;Section 2 – Scope.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;License grant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exceptions and Limitations.&lt;/strong&gt; For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Term.&lt;/strong&gt; The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.&lt;/strong&gt; The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downstream recipients.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. &lt;strong&gt;Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material.&lt;/strong&gt; Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. &lt;strong&gt;No downstream restrictions.&lt;/strong&gt; You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No endorsement.&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other rights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-3-license-conditions&#34;&gt;Section 3 – License Conditions.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attribution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

 ii. a copyright notice;

 iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

 iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter&amp;rsquo;s License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-4-sui-generis-database-rights&#34;&gt;Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-5-disclaimer-of-warranties-and-limitation-of-liability&#34;&gt;Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. &lt;strong&gt;Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. &lt;strong&gt;To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-6-term-and-termination&#34;&gt;Section 6 – Term and Termination.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-7-other-terms-and-conditions&#34;&gt;Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-8-interpretation&#34;&gt;Section 8 – Interpretation.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By accessing the website at &lt;a href=&#34;http://slu-soc1120.github.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://slu-soc1120.github.io&lt;/a&gt;, you are agreeing to be bound by these terms of service, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing this site. The materials contained in this website are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Use License&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;license&#34; href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Creative Commons License&#34; style=&#34;border-width:0&#34; src=&#34;https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/88x31.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work is licensed under a &lt;a href=&#34;/license&#34;&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY 4.0) License&lt;/a&gt;. You are free to &lt;strong&gt;share&lt;/strong&gt; (copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format) and &lt;strong&gt;adapt&lt;/strong&gt; (remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially). The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, you must provide &lt;strong&gt;attribution&lt;/strong&gt; (you must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made). You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do not have to comply with the license for elements of the material in the public domain or where your use is permitted by an applicable exception or limitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No warranties are given. The license may not give you all of the permissions necessary for your intended use. For example, other rights such as publicity, privacy, or moral rights may limit how you use the material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This license applies only to the &lt;strong&gt;content&lt;/strong&gt; of the site and does not apply to Hugo (released under an &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/about/license/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Apache 2.0 License&lt;/a&gt;) or the Academic Theme (released under an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/blob/master/LICENSE.md&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MIT License&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The materials on Christopher Prener&amp;rsquo;s website are provided on an &amp;lsquo;as is&amp;rsquo; basis. Christopher Prener makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.&lt;/p&gt;

Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Accuracy of materials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The materials appearing on Christopher Prener&amp;rsquo;s website could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors.

Christopher Prener may make changes to the materials contained on its website at any time without notice. However Christopher Prener does not make any commitment to update the materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Links&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher Prener has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its website and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Christopher Prener of the site. Use of any such linked website is at the user&amp;rsquo;s own risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Modifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher Prener may revise these terms of service for its website at any time without notice. By using this website you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Governing Law&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
